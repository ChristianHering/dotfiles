About
-----

Dotfiles are user configuration files found in your home folder under the hidden directories of the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html). I've also looped in system configuration files (commonly found in /etc) in this repository via a ~/root -> / mount which can be found in [/etc/fstab](root/etc/fstab).

Compiling from Source
------------

This directory doesn't contain source code, so there's no need to compile anything. If you'd like to use my dotfiles, checkout [CARS](https://github.com/ChristianHering/CARS) or copy/download the files you want.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are always welcome. If you're interested in contributing, send me an email or submit a PR.
